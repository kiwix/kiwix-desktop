Disclaimer
----------

This document assumes you have a little knowledge about software
compilation. If you experience difficulties with the dependencies or
with the Kiwix libary compilation itself, we recommend to have a look
to [kiwix-build](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-build).

Dependencies
------------

The Kiwix Desktop application relies on many third parts software libraries.
Following libraries need to be available:

* [kiwix-lib](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-lib/)
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
* [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/)

These dependencies may or may not be packaged by your operating
system. They may also be packaged but only in an older version. The
compilation script will tell you if one of them is missing or too old.
In the worse case, you will have to download and compile bleeding edge
version by hand.

kiwix-lib has to be compiled dynamically, the best way to have it is
to use [kiwix-build](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-build).

Install needed packages (on Ubuntu 18.04+):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 qtbase5-dev qtwebengine5-dev \
     libqt5svg5-dev qt5-image-formats-plugins qt5-default aria2 \
     qttools5-dev-tools
```

Compilation
-----------

Once all dependencies are installed, you can compile Kiwix Desktop:

```bash
qmake .
make
```

`qmake` will use pkg-config to locate libraries. Depending of where
you've installed kiwix-lib (and other libraries) you may have to
update the env variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. It can be set as follows, 
for example, for x86-64 native systems:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="<...>/BUILD_native_dyn/INSTALL/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig"
```

You may want to simply open the kiwix-desktop project in QtCreator and
then compile the project from there (don't forget to update
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH` if necessary).

Installation
------------

To install Kiwix Desktop on the system:
```bash
sudo make install
```

Run
---

To run Kiwix Desktop
```bash
kiwix-desktop
```

You might have to refresh the `ld` database before:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

If you face problems such as `library not found...`, add the following 
environment variable:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<...>/BUILD_native_dyn/INSTALL/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
```
